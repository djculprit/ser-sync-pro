## 2026-07-27 — GUI Duplication Cleanup (gui-cleanup)

- **Task**: `python/gui.py` had grown two duplication problems: seven async handlers (`_run_backup_alone`, `_run_sort_alone`, `_run_step_alone`, `_run_scan_alone`, `_run_session_scan`, `_run_session_fix`, `_on_start`) each repeated the same ~40-line validate/clear-log/disable-controls/spawn-thread/re-enable skeleton, and five widget-factory functions each rebuilt an identical scan-button/run-button `ButtonStyle`. Deduplicate both without changing any button's behavior.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `python/gui.py` [MODIFIED] — Added `_guard_required()` and `_run_worker()` helpers encapsulating the handler lifecycle; rewrote all seven handlers to call them, keeping each handler's own config-building, step dispatch tables, and session-path logging intact. Added `_scan_button()`/`_run_button()` factories (with a `height` param to preserve `_scan_run_buttons`'s existing `height=28` vs. the usual `30`); replaced all five call sites' inline button construction with factory calls. Net: 1284 → 1168 lines.
- **What Was Done**: Followed `md/actions/gui-cleanup/PLAN.md` phases 1–2. A pre-existing uncommitted `_update_lock` thread-safety fix (wrapping `page.update()` calls) was already committed (`a17c9694`) before this work started, and was preserved through the refactor — every `_run_worker`/`_set_controls_enabled` call still wraps its `page.update()` in `_update_lock`. One deliberate text change carried over from the plan's own example: the backup handler's error log line changed from `"❌ Backup error: …"` to `"❌ Backup failed: …"` to fit the shared `error_label` pattern. Verified: `pytest` 21/21 passing after each phase, GUI boots cleanly (no import/runtime errors), and the user visually confirmed every card row (Backup, Steps 1–4, Reset A→Z, Dupe Manager, Session Fixer) renders pixel-identical to before, with Scan/Run buttons intact. Phase 3 (splitting `gui.py` into multiple modules) was explicitly out of scope for this pass.

## 2026-07-25 — Per-Session File Logging (Volume-Relative)

- **Task**: The Python app had no persistent logging — `main.py --cli` only configured a console handler, and the GUI never touched `logging` at all, so pipeline `logger.info()` calls went nowhere under the GUI. Add per-session log files, matching the location convention of the original Java tool.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `python/core/session_log.py` [NEW] — `session_log_file(name, serato_path)` context manager: attaches a `FileHandler` to the shared `cdd_sync` logger for one run, writing to `<parent of _Serato_>/cdd-sync-pro/logs/<name>-<timestamp>.log`.
  - `python/sync/pipeline.py` [MODIFIED] — `run_sync()` is now a thin wrapper opening a `"sync"` session log around the renamed `_run_sync()`.
  - `python/sync/session_fixer.py` [MODIFIED] — `scan_broken_paths()` / `fix_broken_paths()` wrap `_scan_broken_paths_impl()` / `_fix_broken_paths_impl()` the same way (`"session-scan"` / `"session-fix"`); new `_make_log()` helper threads session-fixer output through `logging.getLogger("cdd_sync")` as well as the existing `log_callback`/GUI path.
  - `run_cli.command` [NEW, untracked — `*.command` is gitignored] — CLI launcher mirroring `run.command`; venv setup, config.yaml check, pauses before closing.
  - `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `md/CHANGELOG.md`, `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`, `md/TODO.md`, `md/CONCEPTS.md` [MODIFIED] — documented the new logging location and module.
- **What Was Done**: Investigated the log location in the archived Java implementation (`cdd_sync_main.java:109`: `seratoDir.getParentFile()` + `"cdd-sync-pro/logs"`) after an initial CWD-relative `python/logs/` implementation was flagged as wrong — Serato libraries live on external volumes, so logs need to travel with the drive. Rebuilt `session_log.py` to derive the log directory from `serato_path` instead of CWD. Verified via a temp-directory smoke test that logs land at `<serato's volume>/cdd-sync-pro/logs/`. Chose one consolidated log per run (not the Java version's seven per-step files) — simpler, still fully timestamped/attributable. `pytest` — 21/21 passing (tests use `tempfile`-based `_Serato_` dirs, so log output during tests lands in the OS temp dir, not the repo).

## 2026-07-24 — Archive Java, Ship v2.1.0, Rename Default Branch

- **Task**: Archive the deprecated Java implementation, merge the `python` branch into the main line, cut an official v2.1.0 release, close gaps found during a smoke test, and rename the default branch from `master` to `main`.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `java/` → `archive/java/` [MOVED] — path references updated in `CLAUDE.md`, `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`
  - `README.md` [REWRITTEN] — replaced Java-era Quick Start/Build/Structure sections with the current Python app's setup, usage, and config reference
  - `python` branch [MERGED] — PR #1, 28 commits, fast-forward, merged into the main line after CI passed
  - `python/config.yaml` [UNTRACKED] — added to `.gitignore`; contains user-specific library paths, `config.template.yaml` is the source-controlled template
  - `python/config.py` [FIXED] — `save()` now writes YAML with `sort_keys=False` so `config.yaml` matches the template's field order instead of alphabetical
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — `[Unreleased]` promoted to `[2.1] — 2026-07-24`; new `[Unreleased]` stub added, then populated with this session's infra changes
  - `python/pyproject.toml`, `python/gui.py` [MODIFIED] — version bumped to `2.1.0`; GUI badge later changed to read the version from `pyproject.toml` at runtime (`_app_version()`) instead of a hardcoded string, after the badge was caught stale during the bump
  - `.github/workflows/build.yml` [MODIFIED] — added a `python-test` job (`pytest` against `python/`) alongside the existing `java-test`; both jobs' trigger branch updated `master` → `main`
  - `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` [FIXED] — stale `python.command` launcher references corrected to `run.command` (caught during smoke test)
  - Default branch renamed `master` → `main` on GitHub; old `origin/master` deleted after confirming CI passed on `main`
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — CI section updated to describe both jobs and the `main` trigger
- **What Was Done**: Moved the Java reference implementation to `archive/java/` and updated every internal path reference. Merged the 28-commit `python` branch into the main line via a reviewed PR (all CI checks green). Fixed a divergent-branch issue caused by a local-only commit made before the merge landed (rebased cleanly, no conflicts). Untracked the personal `config.yaml` and diagnosed why it looked "out of sync" with the template — it wasn't; the GUI's `SyncConfig.save()` just rewrites it alphabetically and comment-free on every save, which was then fixed to preserve field order. Cut and published the v2.1.0 release (annotated tag + GitHub Release). Ran a full smoke test (pytest, `--cli --dry-run` against a real 34,591-track library, confirmed zero disk writes) which caught the `python.command` doc typo. Added the missing Python CI job, since only Java had test coverage despite Python being the primary implementation. Collapsed the GUI version badge and `pyproject.toml` to a single source of truth after the badge was caught out of sync post-bump. Renamed the default branch to `main` (no branch protection was in place; CI re-verified green on `main` before deleting old `master`).

## 2026-04-04 — Doc Hygiene + Plan Closure

- **Task**: Run pending `/run-phase` commits (`py-bugfix` Phase 6, `session-fixer` Phase 4), archive both plans, update all md/ docs to reflect current Python app state
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Project overview updated: Python marked as primary; directory tree rewritten for `python/` layout; Major Modules table replaced with Python module table; Java section demoted to read-only reference
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — `[Unreleased]` block promoted to `[2.0] — Python reimplementation (2026-04)`; clean `[Unreleased]` stub added
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
  - `md/actions/archive/py-bugfix/` [ARCHIVED] — All 6 phases done
  - `md/actions/archive/session-fixer/` [ARCHIVED] — All 4 phases done
- **What Was Done**: Closed two pending PENDING commit phases via `/run-phase`. Archived both completed plans. Performed a full codebase investigation (all `python/` modules, `main.py`, `config.py`, `gui.py`, `session_fixer.py`, `pipeline.py`, `path_utils.py`, test count) and updated CODEBASE_GUIDE, CHANGELOG, and AGENT_LOG to reflect the Python v2 app as the canonical implementation. Test suite: 21 tests passing.

## 2026-04-03 — Flet Dark-Mode GUI Window (py-gui)

- **Task**: Build a polished dark-mode Flet GUI equivalent to the Java `cdd_sync_pro_window.java`
- **Files Changed**:
  - `python/gui.py` [NEW] — Full Flet GUI: dark app shell, config panel (paths/steps/dupes), live log ListView, Start/Cancel wiring, dry-run checkbox, progress bar
  - `python/main.py` [MODIFIED] — GUI/CLI split: `--cli` flag runs headless, default launches Flet GUI via `gui.launch()`
  - `python/requirements.txt` [MODIFIED] — Added `flet>=0.21.0`
  - `python/sync/pipeline.py` [MODIFIED] — Minor log callback compatibility fixes
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Implemented all 4 build phases of the `py-gui` plan. GUI opens at 780×760, dark theme, SF Pro font. Config panel has 3 path rows with FilePicker Browse buttons, 7 pipeline step checkboxes (with Clear Library confirmation dialog), dry-run checkbox, and duplicate management dropdowns. Log panel streams output live via `page.run_thread`. Start validates inputs, builds SyncConfig, saves config.yaml, and launches `run_sync()` on a daemon thread. Cancel appends a stop-request message. Polish pass: min window size, section borders, status label, progress bar. `main.py --cli --dry-run` still runs headlessly.
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here

## 2026-04-02 — Python Pipeline Implementation (py-pipeline)

- **Task**: Port sync pipeline from Java to Python
- **Files Changed**:
  - `python/config.py` [NEW] — SyncConfig dataclass with YAML load/save
  - `python/config.template.yaml` [NEW] — annotated config template
  - `python/sync/__init__.py` [NEW] — sync package marker
  - `python/sync/media_library.py` [NEW] — recursive media scanner with parallel ThreadPoolExecutor
  - `python/sync/backup.py` [NEW] — timestamped _Serato_ backup utility
  - `python/sync/dupe_mover.py` [NEW] — duplicate scanner and mover with dupes.log
  - `python/sync/pref_sorter.py` [NEW] — neworder.pref generator in UTF-16BE
  - `python/sync/database_fixer.py` [NEW] — binary database V2 TLV path patcher
  - `python/sync/pipeline.py` [NEW] — run_sync() orchestrator + all crate-fixer helpers
  - `python/main.py` [NEW] — CLI entry point with --dry-run flag
  - `python/tests/test_pipeline.py` [NEW] — 4 integration tests (dry-run, step4, step2, sorting)
  - `python/core/serato_parser.py` [MODIFIED] — fixed dynamic vrsn header skip for variable-length version strings
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — this entry
- **What Was Done**: Implemented all 5 pipeline phases. All 21 tests pass (17 existing + 4 new). java/ directory completely unmodified. One bug fixed in serato_parser.py (vrsn header skip was hardcoded to 8-byte version field, failing on non-4-char versions in test binaries).
- **Docs to Update**: None

## 2026-04-02 — Python Migration Foundation (py-migrate Phase 1–3)

- **Task**: Scaffold Python 3.12+ project and implement binary parsing foundation
- **Files Changed**:
  - `python/pyproject.toml` [NEW] — project metadata, flet + pyyaml deps
  - `python/requirements.txt` [NEW] — runtime dependencies
  - `python/requirements-dev.txt` [NEW] — dev dependencies (pytest)
  - `python/.gitignore` [NEW] — Python-specific ignores
  - `python/core/__init__.py` [NEW] — package marker
  - `python/core/path_utils.py` [NEW] — NFC/NFD path normalization (ports cdd_sync_binary_utils)
  - `python/core/binary_utils.py` [NEW] — low-level binary I/O helpers
  - `python/core/serato_parser.py` [NEW] — Crate + SeratoDatabase read/write (ports cdd_sync_crate, cdd_sync_database)
  - `python/tests/__init__.py` [NEW] — test package marker
  - `python/tests/test_path_utils.py` [NEW] — 8 path normalization tests
  - `python/tests/test_serato_parser.py` [NEW] — 6 crate round-trip tests
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — this entry
- **What Was Done**: Implemented Phases 1–3 of the Python migration. Binary parser is a direct port of the Java TLV reader/writer with byte-for-byte round-trip fidelity. All 14 tests pass. Java source in `java/` untouched.
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here

## 2026-04-02 — Python Migration Architecture + Action Plan (py-migrate)

- **Task**: Senior architect assessment of Java→Python migration; produce 4-phase action plan for a builder agent
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/PLAN.md` [NEW] — 4-phase plan: scaffold, binary parser, tests, commit
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/PHASE_1.md` [NEW] — Project scaffold (pyproject.toml, requirements)
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/PHASE_2.md` [NEW] — Core binary parsing foundation (path_utils, binary_utils, serato_parser)
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/PHASE_3.md` [NEW] — pytest suite: 14 tests (path normalization + crate round-trip)
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/PHASE_4.md` [NEW] — AGENT_LOG update + commit
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/ORCHESTRATE.md` [NEW] — Dispatch guide for orchestrator
  - `md/actions/py-migrate/AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Pre-filled audit state machine (4 rows, all PENDING)
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Produced full architectural assessment (6 evaluation dimensions, weighted pros/cons matrix, strategic recommendations). Locked all decisions: Flet GUI, PyYAML config, custom struct binary parser (no serato-tools), session-fixer deferred, Python 3.12+. Produced 6 action-plan artefacts per skill protocol. Plan gates Phase 2 on NFC/NFD parity test; Phase 3 on byte-for-byte binary round-trip identity; pipeline + GUI phases deferred to future plans.
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here. Execute plan via `md/actions/py-migrate/ORCHESTRATE.md`.

## 2026-03-31 — Hygiene Audit + Action Plan (hygiene-fixes)

- **Task**: Audit core components for hygiene findings; produce a 5-phase action plan for another agent to execute
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PLAN.md` [NEW] — 5-phase plan (binary encoding, docs, main guard, GUI, commit)
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PHASE_1.md` [NEW] — Parser desync + StandardCharsets + sortingRev sentinel
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PHASE_2.md` [NEW] — Stale Javadoc + path sep one-liner
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PHASE_3.md` [NEW] — `_Serato_` path guard + FQN cleanup in main
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PHASE_4.md` [NEW] — step0 checkbox wiring (6 write sites)
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/PHASE_5.md` [NEW] — Full clean build + commit
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/ORCHESTRATE.md` [NEW] — Dispatch guide for orchestrator
  - `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Pre-filled audit state machine (5 rows, all PENDING)
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Performed a senior-level hygiene audit across 8 core components. Found 22 findings (9 Medium, 13 Low, 0 Critical). Collapsed the highest-value 9 findings into a 5-phase action plan using file-overlap grouping (9 → 5 phases). Produced all 7 action-plan artefacts per skill protocol. Risk assessment: 1.5/10 breakage probability — all changes are non-breaking hygiene (encoding constants, parser safety, doc corrections, UI wiring).
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here. Execute plan via `md/actions/hygiene-fixes/ORCHESTRATE.md`.

## 2026-03-31 — Step 2 Crate Fixer: Wire Database Encoding (Match Steps 3 & 4)

- **Task**: Fix Step 2 (`fixExistingCrates`) to use Serato's exact filename encoding from `database V2`, matching the pattern already used by Steps 3 & 4 via `addTrack()` → `resolveSeratoPath()`
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — `fixExistingCrates()` gains `cdd_sync_database` param; path-fix loop now calls `resolveSeratoPath()` before `normalizePathForDatabase()`; `fixBrokenPaths()` facade passes `database` through (was silently discarding it)
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Step 2 call site now passes the already-loaded `database` variable
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — New fixed entry under [Unreleased]
- **What Was Done**: Diagnosed divergence between Step 2 and Steps 3 & 4: Steps 3 & 4 call `crate.setDatabase(db)` + `addTrack()` → `resolveSeratoPath()` to use Serato's raw NFD-encoded filename; Step 2 called `normalizePathForDatabase(candidates.get(0))` directly, producing an NFC filesystem path that Serato couldn't match in its database, triggering silent orphan creation. Added `database` parameter to `fixExistingCrates()`, applied `resolveSeratoPath()` in the resolution loop. `resolveSeratoPath()` is null-safe — no-op when database is null or has no match. `ant test` → 26/26 ✔ BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here

## 2026-03-31 — Dedup Key Refactor: filename-only NFC normalization

- **Task**: Refine `addTrack()` dedup key from full-path NFC to filename-leaf-only NFC+lowercase; update CODEBASE_GUIDE.md Step 2 note
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate.java` [MODIFIED] — Extracted `normalizeForDedup()` (filename leaf, NFC+lowercase); `addTrack()` and `setTracksRaw()` use it instead of `cdd_sync_binary_utils.normalizePath()`; `resolveSeratoPath()` call preserved for the stored value
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Step 2 note updated: "first match is used (no ambiguity skip)"
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — NFC/NFD dedup entry revised to document filename-only key rationale
- **What Was Done**: Previous dedup key used the full resolved path (NFC+lowercase). That keyed differently for relative crate paths vs. absolute filesystem paths, causing the same physical file to appear under two different keys → insert not blocked. Switching to filename-leaf-only eliminates the relative/absolute mismatch entirely. The resolved/absolute path is still stored as the track value — only the dedup key changed.
- **Docs to Update**: None — done here

## 2026-03-31 — Dedup Fix + UI Label Cleanup + Fix Paths Removal

- **Task**: Restore NFC/NFD dedup in `addTrack()`; expand abbreviated GUI labels; remove redundant Fix Paths button
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate.java` [MODIFIED] — Added `normalizedTrackSet HashSet`; `addTrack()` skips duplicates via `normalizePath()` key; `setTracksRaw()` rebuilds set
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_pro_window.java` [MODIFIED] — Removed `fixPathsButton`, `onFixPathsCallback`, `onFixPathsClicked()`, `setOnFixPathsCallback()`; expanded 6 Pipeline Steps labels to full descriptive names
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Removed `runFixPaths()` method and SwingWorker wiring block
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Three new entries under [Unreleased]
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Diagnosed NFC/NFD duplicate: macOS returns NFD filenames; crate stores NFC. Without normalization, same file appeared as two distinct paths → double insert. Fixed by keying the dedup set via `normalizePath()` (already does NFC + lowercase).
  2. Confirmed Fix Paths button was a legacy facade calling Steps 1+2 only, predating per-step toggles. Removed entirely — no functionality lost.
  3. Expanded all 6 Pipeline Steps checkbox labels to full names per user spec.
  4. `ant jar` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG.md — done

## 2026-03-31 — TLV Parser Refactor + Column Width Round-Trip Fix

- **Task**: Replace fragile two-loop `readFrom()` with a unified TLV walker; fix Step 2 rewriting crates as blank (tvcw column widths destroyed); align Step 2 write pattern with Steps 3 & 4
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate.java` [MODIFIED] — `readFrom()` replaced with single `while` TLV loop + `readFully()` payload capture; four private helpers (`extractPtrk`, `extractTvcn`, `extractOsrt`, `walkPayloadForTag`, `readBigEndianInt`); added `rawOsrtPayload` / `rawOvctPayloads` fields; `writeTo()` emits raw payloads verbatim for existing crates, falls back to defaults for new crates
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — `fixExistingCrates()` write block replaced: scratch `fixedCrate` copy removed, now mutates read `crate` in-place via `setTracksRaw()` then `crate.writeTo()` — same pattern as Steps 3 & 4
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Three new entries under [Unreleased]
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Replaced `readFrom()` two-loop + `mark/reset` with a single unified TLV pass. Each block read via `readFully(byte[] payload)` before dispatch — stream slippage now impossible regardless of `ovct`/`osrt` column count.
  2. Diagnosed blank crate bug: `writeTo()` hardcodes `tvcw = "0"` for all columns. Confirmed via binary diff: backup has real pixel widths (`"76"`, `"580"`, etc.); post-run live file had `"0"` for all. Serato rendered 0-width columns as blank.
  3. Fixed via raw block passthrough: `readFrom()` now stores raw `ovct`/`osrt` payloads; `writeTo()` writes them verbatim. Zero parsing of `tvcw` values required. Step 4 (new crates) unaffected — empty raw lists → existing default logic.
  4. Fixed Step 2 write pattern: scratch `fixedCrate` copy removed; in-place mutation + `crate.writeTo()` matches Steps 3 & 4 exactly.
  5. `ant all` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (all 3 JARs). Verified live in Serato — `26-01-17` crate tracks visible again.
- **Architecture Note**: `readFrom()` is now a true round-trip parser — any block it reads, it can write back bit-for-bit. The `writeTo()` reconstruction path (osrt + ovct defaults) is now the new-crate path only.
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG.md — done

## 2026-03-31 — Audit Previous Session + Remove Step 2 Ambiguity Guard

- **Task**: Audit the last agent session (Step 2 Filesystem Decoupling); confirm/remove the `candidates.size() > 1` ambiguity guard from `fixExistingCrates()` so filenames with multiple library paths resolve to the first match instead of being skipped
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Step 2 description updated to state "first match is used (no ambiguity skip)" and documents rationale (files are moved, not copied — true collisions rare; skipping silently was the worse failure mode)
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Loaded context, confirmed last session's screenshot showing BUILD SUCCESSFUL and "ambiguity guard is gone."
  2. Audited `cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` in full. Step 2 already uses `candidates.get(0)` with no size guard — the removal was performed in the previous session (confirmed). Javadoc on line 35 already updated. No Java change required.
  3. Step 1 (`updateDatabasePaths`) retains its `candidates.size() > 1` guard — intentional; incorrect DB paths are harder to recover from than crate paths.
  4. `ant compile` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
  5. Patched `CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` Step 2 description.
- **Architecture Note**: Step 2 now always resolves to the first candidate, not skips. Rationale: files are moved, not copied, so filename collisions don't occur in practice. The old skip was causing orphaned orange tracks — the silent failure was worse than an occasional misresolution.
- **Docs to Update**: None — updated here

## 2026-03-31 — Step 2 Filesystem Decoupling + getAllTrackPaths Bug Fix

- **Task**: Diagnose why Step 2 only fixed 1 crate path; fix root cause; decouple Step 2 from the database
- **Files Changed**:
  - `shared/src/cdd_sync_database.java` [MODIFIED] — `getAllTrackPaths()` was returning `tracksByFilenameOnly.values()` (1 entry per unique filename — later DB entries silently overwrote earlier ones). Fixed to return `tracksByPath.values()` (keyed by `normalizedPath|size` — all unique tracks)
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — `fixExistingCrates()` signature changed from `cdd_sync_database` to `cdd_sync_media_library`; now builds lookup index from the live filesystem via the existing `buildLibraryIndex()` helper; converts absolute paths to relative via `normalizePathForDatabase()` before comparison; `fixBrokenPaths()` facade updated — DB reload between Step 1 and Step 2 removed
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Step 2 call site now passes `fsLibrary` directly instead of reloading the database; updated inline comment
  - `test/cdd_sync_db_scan.java` [NEW] — Read-only diagnostic scanner: parses `database V2`, checks each `pfil` path against the filesystem, groups broken paths by directory. Accepts optional keyword filter. Zero writes.
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Diagnosed Step 2 only fixing 1 path: `getAllTrackPaths()` used `tracksByFilenameOnly` — a HashMap that silently kept only the last-parsed entry per filename. A 32,863-track DB was being presented to Step 2 as a fraction of its real size. Fixed to use `tracksByPath` (all unique entries).
  2. Identified second root cause: even with the DB bug fixed, Step 2 was still DB-dependent — crate paths for tracks Serato had never indexed (no `otrk` record) could not be resolved. Those orphaned crate references caused Serato to generate new `bmis=true` records on next open, perpetuating the orange track cycle.
  3. Decoupled Step 2 entirely from the database. It now uses the scanned filesystem library as source of truth. The `buildLibraryIndex()` helper already existed in `cdd_sync_crate_fixer` — Step 2 now calls it directly. Ambiguity guard unchanged (2+ files with same filename → skip).
  4. Added read-only `cdd_sync_db_scan` diagnostic tool to `test/`. Compiles against existing classpath. Run via: `java -cp out/production/cdd-sync-pro cdd_sync_db_scan <serato_path> [filter]`
  5. `ant compile` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL after each change.
- **Architecture Note**: Steps 1 and 2 are now fully independent. Step 2 alone (with Step 1 off) is sufficient to fix all crate paths as long as the files exist on the filesystem. Step 1 still recommended to keep the database consistent.
- **Docs to Update**: `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` — Step 2 description in the crate_fixer module section

## 2026-03-31 — Audit + Dead Code Removal (processCrateFile)

- **Task**: Audit the last two agent sessions; remove dead `processCrateFile()` method found during scoring
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — Removed orphaned `processCrateFile()` (62 lines, superseded multi-threaded Step 2 implementation with `ConcurrentHashMap`/ambiguity logic); removed stale duplicate Javadoc on `fixExistingCrates()`; corrected swapped internal section-header comments (`Step 1`/`Step 3` labels were inverted vs. actual pipeline execution order)
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Added per-step pipeline debug toggle entry to [Unreleased] (deferred from 2026-03-31 session)
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Audited 2026-03-31 session (Per-Step Pipeline Debug Toggles) — all 3 audit targets passed clean. `canFix`/`isFixBrokenPathsEnabled` zero hits, all 5 step gates confirmed, `fixBrokenPathsCheck` zero hits, Pipeline Steps panel has 8 items in correct order. Only finding: `CHANGELOG.md` entry deferred by prior agent.
  2. Audited 2026-03-30 session (4-Step Sync Pipeline + Log Re-Init Bug Fix) — scored 9.2/10. Log re-init fix confirmed, 7-writer structure confirmed, all 4 public step methods confirmed. Finding: `processCrateFile()` was dead private code never called after Step 2 was rewritten as a flat-map single-pass loop.
  3. Patched `cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java`: deleted dead method, fixed section headers, removed stale Javadoc. `ant compile` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

## 2026-03-31 — Per-Step Pipeline Debug Toggles

- **Task**: Add independent on/off switches for each step of the sync pipeline so individual steps can be isolated during debugging without running the full pipeline
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_config.java` [MODIFIED] — Added `// Pipeline Step Toggles` section with 5 new getters: `isStep0Enabled()` → `isStep4Enabled()`; all read `sync.stepN.enabled` properties, default `true`
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — All 5 pipeline sites in `runSync()` now gated by their respective step toggles; `canFix` variable removed — Steps 1 & 2 are now gated solely by `!isClearLibraryBeforeSync()` + their own step toggle; skip log messages added per step
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_pro_window.java` [MODIFIED] — "Sync Options" panel removed; all controls (backup, clear library, step toggles, sort crates) merged into a single **Pipeline Steps** panel in execution order (Pre-1 → Pre-2 → Step 0 → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 → Post); `fixBrokenPathsCheck` field fully removed (field, init, grid.add, load, collect, setEnabled); all `database.fix.broken.paths` writes removed from GUI
  - `cdd-sync-pro/cdd-sync.properties.template` [MODIFIED] — Added `# Debug — Pipeline Steps` block documenting all 5 `sync.stepN.enabled` keys
- **What Was Done**:
  1. Added 5 boolean config getters (`isStep0Enabled()`–`isStep4Enabled()`).
  2. Gated all 5 execution sites in `runSync()`: Step 0 (both early dupe-move block and late log-only scan), Steps 1–4. Each site logs a specific skip message when toggled off.
  3. Removed the redundant `database.fix.broken.paths` master gate — Steps 1 & 2 already have their own toggles. The only remaining guard for Steps 1 & 2 is "Clear Library" (which deletes the database, making path-fixing a no-op).
  4. Merged "Sync Options" panel into "Pipeline Steps" panel; all 8 controls (Pre-1 Backup, Pre-2 Clear Library, Step 0–4, Post Sort) are now visible in a single labeled grid in execution order.
  5. `ant compile` verified clean after each of the 4 phases (config, main, window, template).
- **Architecture Note**: Step 0 (duplicate management) gates **both** occurrence sites: the early dupe-move block (before Step 1) and the late log-only scan (after Step 4). Step 0 only logs a skip message when `harddrive.dupe.scan.enabled=true` — otherwise it's a no-op regardless.
- **Audit Targets** (for another agent to verify):
  - `cdd_sync_main.java` → `runSync()`: confirm no reference to `canFix` or `isFixBrokenPathsEnabled()` remains; confirm all 5 step sites are gated; confirm Step 0 early + late sites both check `isStep0Enabled()`
  - `cdd_sync_pro_window.java` → confirm zero references to `fixBrokenPathsCheck`; confirm `buildPipelineStepsPanel()` returns 8 items in execution order; confirm `loadFromProperties()` / `collectProperties()` / `setControlsEnabled()` have no stale references
  - `cdd_sync_config.java` → confirm 5 step getters present in `// Pipeline Step Toggles` section; all default `true`
- **Docs to Update**: `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing: new debug step toggles in GUI)

## 2026-03-30 — 4-Step Sync Pipeline + Log Re-Init Bug Fix

- **Task**: Replace monolithic `cdd_sync_library.writeTo()` with a 4-step decoupled pipeline; fix log writer re-initialization bug for multi-run GUI sessions
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_crate_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — New 4-step API: `updateDatabasePaths()`, `fixExistingCrates()` (uses `setTracksRaw()`), `appendNewTracksToMatchingCrates()`, `createNewCrates()`; backward-compat `fixBrokenPaths()` facade retained
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — `runSync()` replaced `cdd_sync_library` call with explicit Steps 1–4; `runFixPaths()` added for Fix Paths button mode
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_pro_window.java` [MODIFIED] — Amber **Fix Paths** button added; all controls wired with `[DEBUG]` tooltips; `clearLibraryCheck` guarded with confirmation dialog
  - `shared/src/cdd_sync_log.java` [MODIFIED] — (bug fix) `GUI_INITIALIZED` reset on `setLogDirectory()` so repeat GUI runs open fresh log files; 7-writer structure (step1–step4 + fix + dupe + main)
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — 4-step pipeline + Fix Paths + diagnostic logs added to [Unreleased]
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Sync flow diagram replaced; crate_fixer module detail updated to 4-step; log module updated to 7-writer
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Completed decoupling of the sync pipeline so no step can overwrite another's work. Diagnosed and fixed a re-entrant log initialization bug where clicking Start twice in the GUI resulted in the second run writing to already-closed log file handles (silent NPE). Fix: `setLogDirectory()` now resets `GUI_INITIALIZED` to false so `initLogFile()` is called fresh on the next log write.
- **Docs to Update**: None — all updated here

## 2026-03-07 — Docs Refresh: README + md/

- **Task**: Refresh `README.md` and all `md/` documentation files to match current codebase state
- **Files Changed**:
  - `README.md` [MODIFIED] — Corrected all `ser_sync_*` → `cdd_sync_*` filename references; added 3 new shared files (`cdd_sync_binary_utils`, `cdd_sync_fatal_exception`, `cdd_sync_log_window_handler`); added `cdd_sync_pro_window.java`; added `ant test` build target; corrected properties filename to `cdd-sync.properties`; updated log path; added GUI Config Window feature bullet; updated project structure tree (added `s3-smart-sync/`, `md/`, `test/`, `lib/`)
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Corrected all `ser_sync_*` → `cdd_sync_*` references throughout; updated directory structure, module table, data flow diagrams, utility classes section, config filenames, and cross-reference links; split logging section to cover all 3 log classes; added `cdd_sync_fatal_exception`
  - `md/CONCEPTS.md` [MODIFIED] — Corrected `ser_sync_track_index` → `cdd_sync_track_index`
- **What Was Done**: Audited all `md/` files and README against actual on-disk source file listing. `TODO.md`, `DATABASE_GUIDE.md` were current; no changes needed there.
- **Docs to Update**: None

## 2026-03-07 — Audit #1 Fixes — Action Plan for Another Agent

- **Task**: Produce `AUDIT_FIXES_PLAN.md`, `EXECUTE.md`, and `AUDIT_FIXES_AUDIT.md` for five findings from Audit #1 of cdd-sync-pro
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/actions/AUDIT_FIXES_PLAN.md` [NEW] — 7-phase plan fixing C5-1 (Serato path encoding 3×), C5-2 (readInt dupe), C4-1 (silent IOException), C4-2 (silent Exception), C4-4 (inline NFC normalization)
  - `md/actions/EXECUTE.md` [MODIFIED] — Execution prompt rewritten for this batch
  - `md/actions/AUDIT_FIXES_AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Pre-filled audit skeleton (7 rows)
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Conducted full multi-audit of all sub-projects (cdd-sync-pro Java, session-fixer Java, shared library, s3-smart-sync Python). Produced `AUDIT_REPORT.md` with 15 findings rated 1–5. Extracted the 5 highest-concern findings into a 7-phase no-deviation action plan. Phases 1–6 cover code changes (extracting `resolveSeratoPath()` to `cdd_sync_binary_utils`, delegating the 3 copy-paste sites, replacing inline `readInt`, logging silenced catches, replacing 5 inline NFC normalization calls). Phase 7 is the commit. No source code changed — plan only.
- **Docs to Update**: TODO.md (when plan is executed)

## 2026-03-06 — Execute Class Rename: ser_sync_*→ cdd_sync_*

- **Task**: Execute `RENAME_CLASSES_PLAN.md` — 30-phase rename of all `ser_sync_*` Java source files, class declarations, and cross-references across the full codebase
- **Files Changed**:
  - `shared/src/cdd_sync_{exception,fatal_exception,input_stream,output_stream,binary_utils,log_window,log_window_handler,log,media_library,backup,database,database_fixer}.java` [RENAMED from `ser_sync_*`]
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/cdd_sync_{config,crate,crate_fixer,crate_scanner,database_entry_selector,dupe_mover,file_utils,library,main,pref_sorter,pro_window,track_index}.java` [RENAMED from `ser_sync_*`]
  - `test/cdd_sync_{binary_utils_test,crate_test}.java` [RENAMED from `ser_sync_*`]
  - `build.xml` [MODIFIED] — `main.class` and test arg values updated via sed cascade
  - `md/actions/RENAME_CLASSES_AUDIT.md` [MODIFIED] — All 30 rows filled with actual verify output and sign-off
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Executed all 30 phases in strict order per EXECUTE.md protocol — no deviations except one: Phase 28 zero-leak check found a string literal `createTempFile("ser_sync_test", ...)` (not a class reference). Agent stopped, reported, received user approval, fixed with `sed -i ''`, re-verified clean. Build: `ant clean && ant all && ant test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 26/26 tests pass. Commit `76346fa` pushed to `origin/master`. All audit sign-off boxes checked.
- **Docs to Update**: None

## 2026-03-06 — Class Rename Plan: ser_sync_*→ cdd_sync_*

- **Task**: Scope and document the Java class rename refactor as a phased action plan for another agent to execute
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/actions/RENAME_CLASSES_PLAN.md` [NEW] — 30-phase plan: git mv + sed cascade for 24 source files + 2 test files + build.xml
  - `md/actions/EXECUTE.md` [MODIFIED] — Execution prompt rewritten for this plan
  - `md/actions/RENAME_CLASSES_AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Pre-filled audit skeleton (30 rows)
  - `md/TODO.md` [MODIFIED] — Class rename added to Backlog
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — This entry
- **What Was Done**: Audited the full `ser_sync_*` reference graph across 27 Java files and `build.xml`. Identified correct rename ordering to exploit substring-match cascade (e.g. Phase 6 on `ser_sync_log_window` automatically updates `ser_sync_log_window_handler` references via sed). Produced a zero-ambiguity 30-phase plan with verbatim commands and verify steps. No source code changed — plan only.
- **Docs to Update**: None — all updated here.

## 2026-03-06 — Rename Audit + Javadoc Cleanup

- **Task**: Audit previous rename agent's execution; fix remaining `ser-sync-pro` leaks missed by plan scope
- **Files Changed**:
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_binary_utils.java` [MODIFIED] — Javadoc comment (last stale reference in codebase)
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_log.java` [MODIFIED] — Log filename + startup/finish messages (prior session, commit `2f22625`)
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_backup.java` [MODIFIED] — `BACKUP_FOLDER_NAME` on-disk path (prior session)
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_log_window_handler.java` [MODIFIED] — Window + confirm dialog title (prior session)
  - `session-fixer/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` + `README.md` [MODIFIED] — Stale cross-references (prior session)
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Added this entry
- **What Was Done**: Audit confirmed rename plan's `shared/` exclusion was too broad — three shared files had functional product-name strings (log paths, backup paths, window titles) that were wrong at runtime. Prior session fixed 4 of 5 (commit `2f22625`). This session cleared the last Javadoc reference and filed the missing log entry.
- **Docs to Update**: None

## 2026-03-06 — Project Rename: ser-sync-pro → cdd-sync-pro

- **Task**: Execute `RENAME_TO_CDD_SYNC_PRO.md` — full product rename across source silo, build system, Java runtime strings, IDE project files, and all documentation
- **Files Changed**:
  - `ser-sync-pro/` → `cdd-sync-pro/` [RENAMED] — Source silo directory (13 files inside, all tracked)
  - `build.xml` [MODIFIED] — Project name, src/build/dist dirs, jar name, classpaths (11 replacements)
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Log dir path + startup message
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_dupe_mover.java` [MODIFIED] — `DUPES_FOLDER` constant + Javadoc comment
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_pro_window.java` [MODIFIED] — Window title + config comment + Javadoc
  - `cdd-sync-pro/ser-sync.properties.template` [MODIFIED] — `--dry-run` example JAR name
  - `distr/ser-sync-pro/ser-sync.properties` [MODIFIED] — Comment header
  - `.project` [MODIFIED] — Eclipse `<name>` tag
  - `.classpath` [MODIFIED] — Eclipse classpath output path
  - `README.md` [MODIFIED] — Title, badge URL, paths, JAR names, directory tree (~15 occurrences)
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — All path and product name references (~20 occurrences)
  - `md/AGENT_LOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Historical file path references (18 occurrences)
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Product name references
  - `md/TODO.md` [MODIFIED] — Header
  - `md/CONCEPTS.md` [MODIFIED] — Header
  - `md/DATABASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Link text
  - `md/actions/RENAME_TO_CDD_SYNC_PRO.md` [NEW] — The rename plan itself
- **What Was Done**: Executed all agent-executable phases of the rename plan (Phases 1–7). Phase 1: renamed source silo directory. Phases 2–6: surgically updated build.xml, 3 Java source files, properties template, generated artifact, and IDE project files. Phase 5: mass sed-replaced all 6 doc files + README. Phase 7: `ant clean && ant all && ant test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 26/26 tests pass, `distr/cdd-sync-pro/cdd-sync-pro.jar` confirmed present. Committed and pushed to origin.
- **Docs to Update**: None — all updated in this session. M1 (GitHub repo rename) and M2 (remote URL update) are manual steps pending user action.

## 2026-03-06 — Execute CI Pipeline + Dry-Run Plans

- **Task**: Execute `CI_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` and `DRY_RUN_PLAN.md` per `EXECUTE.md` protocol — all phases in order, one file per phase, verified after each
- **Files Changed**:
  - `.github/workflows/build.yml` [NEW] — GitHub Actions workflow: `ant test` on push/PR to `master`
  - `README.md` [MODIFIED] — CI badge added below `h1` heading
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_config.java` [MODIFIED] — Added `dryRun` field, `isDryRun()`, `setDryRun()`
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — `main()` parses `--dry-run`; all 7 write sites in `runSync()` guarded with `[DRY RUN]` log output
  - `cdd-sync-pro/ser-sync.properties.template` [MODIFIED] — Appended `--dry-run` comment block (docs only, no new keys)
  - `md/TODO.md` [MODIFIED] — Moved both CI and dry-run items to `## Done`
- **What Was Done**: Executed two pre-written phased plans end-to-end. CI plan: 4 phases (workflow file, README badge, TODO update, commit+push). Dry-run plan: 6 phases (config getter/setter, arg parsing, 7 write-site guards, template docs, TODO update, commit+push). All 26 tests pass post-execution. Two clean commits pushed to `origin/master`.
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG.md (CI workflow is a user-facing feature worth logging)

## 2026-03-06 — Action Plan Skill + CI Pipeline + Dry-Run Plans

- **Task**: Establish the `md/actions/` planning protocol and produce the first two feature plans with prompt and audit skeletons
- **Files Changed**:
  - `.agents/skills/action-plan/SKILL.md` [NEW] — 4-step skill: Plan → Prompt → Audit → Docs+Commit
  - `md/actions/CI_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` [NEW] — Phased plan for GitHub Actions CI pipeline
  - `md/actions/DRY_RUN_PLAN.md` [NEW] — Phased plan for `--dry-run` CLI flag (6 phases, 7 write sites)
  - `md/actions/EXECUTE.md` [NEW] — Bulletproof execution prompt for another agent to run both plans
  - `md/actions/CI_PIPELINE_AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Audit skeleton for CI plan
  - `md/actions/DRY_RUN_AUDIT.md` [NEW] — Audit skeleton for dry-run plan
- **What Was Done**: Defined the `action-plan` agent skill governing a strict 4-artefact protocol (PLAN, EXECUTE, AUDIT, docs+commit) for all future feature shipping. Produced CI pipeline plan (4 phases) and dry-run flag plan (6 phases) as the first executed instances of the skill. Both include verbatim code, exact verify steps, and no fallback paths.
- **Docs to Update**: TODO.md (when plans are executed)

## 2026-03-01 — Codebase Cleanup (Health Check Pt. 3)

- **Task**: Execute all 8 phases of the ACTION_PLAN codebase cleanup
- **Files Changed**:
  - `build.xml` [MODIFIED] — Test target Java 1.8→11, added `ser_sync_crate_test` class
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_config.java` [MODIFIED] — try-with-resources constructor
  - `session-fixer/src/session_fixer_config.java` [MODIFIED] — try-with-resources constructor
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_binary_utils.java` [MODIFIED] — Added `normalizePath()` + `normalizePathForDatabase()`
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_database.java` [MODIFIED] — Delegates normalization, removed unused import
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_crate_scanner.java` [MODIFIED] — Delegates normalization, removed unused import
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_database_fixer.java` [MODIFIED] — Delegates normalization, otrk block indexing
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_crate.java` [MODIFIED] — `getUniformTrackName()` delegates to shared util
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_dupe_mover.java` [MODIFIED] — Static→instance state, removed verbose logging
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_media_library.java` [MODIFIED] — Regex→Set extension check
  - `session-fixer/src/session_fixer_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Removed `System.exit(0)`
  - `test/ser_sync_binary_utils_test.java` [MODIFIED] — Added 8 normalization tests
  - `test/ser_sync_crate_test.java` [NEW] — 3 crate round-trip tests
  - `md/ACTION_PLAN.md` [DELETED] — Plan fully executed
  - `md/TODO.md` [MODIFIED] — Removed completed cleanup phases
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [MODIFIED] — Added cleanup entry
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Updated for all refactors
- **What Was Done**: Executed all 8 phases: fixed stream leaks, consolidated 4 duplicated path normalizations, converted dupe mover to instance state, replaced regex with Set, removed verbose logging, removed System.exit(0), indexed otrk blocks (O(N²)→O(N)), added 11 new tests (26 total). Clean build, all tests pass.
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG, CODEBASE_GUIDE, TODO (all done)

## 2026-02-12 — Interactive GUI Config Window

- **Task**: Add dark-themed config panel matching Music Timestamp Agent style
- **Files Changed**:
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_pro_window.java` [NEW] — Full config + log GUI window (467 lines)
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_log_window.java` [MODIFIED] — Refactored: protected fields, handler injection
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_config.java` [MODIFIED] — Added Properties-based constructor + getProperties()
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — GUI/CLI branching, SwingWorker, cross-platform L&F
- **What Was Done**: Built interactive config window with path Browse buttons, sync option checkboxes, dupe management dropdowns, log output area, Start/Cancel buttons. Dark theme via Metal L&F. Settings load from and save back to `ser-sync.properties`. Base log window kept in `shared/` (Option A) so session-fixer is unaffected.
- **New Concepts**: SwingWorker (background threading for Swing), Look and Feel (Metal vs Aqua)
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG, CODEBASE_GUIDE

## 2026-02-12 — Logs to Volume + Collection.equals Bug Fix

- **Task**: Move log output to volume; fix smart crate write always rewriting all crates
- **Files Changed**:
  - `shared/src/ser_sync_log.java` [MODIFIED] — Added `setLogDirectory()` and `LOG_DIR` field
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_main.java` [MODIFIED] — Calls `setLogDirectory()` with volume path
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/ser_sync_crate.java` [MODIFIED] — `getColumns()` returns `unmodifiableList()` instead of `unmodifiableCollection()`
- **What Was Done**: Fixed root cause of smart crate write always rewriting: `Collections.unmodifiableCollection()` doesn't override `equals()`, falling back to identity comparison. One-line fix to `unmodifiableList()`. Also added configurable log directory so logs write to `<volume>/cdd-sync-pro/logs/`.
- **New Concepts**: None
- **Docs to Update**: CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-12 — Silo Restructure (shared/src + cdd-sync-pro/src)

- **Task**: Restructure monolithic `src/` into three source directories mirroring the session-fixer silo pattern
- **Files Changed**:
  - `shared/src/` [NEW] — 9 files moved from `src/` (ser_sync_backup, ser_sync_database, ser_sync_database_fixer, ser_sync_exception, ser_sync_input_stream, ser_sync_log, ser_sync_log_window, ser_sync_media_library, ser_sync_output_stream)
  - `cdd-sync-pro/src/` [NEW] — 11 files moved from `src/` (ser_sync_main, ser_sync_config, ser_sync_crate, ser_sync_crate_fixer, ser_sync_crate_scanner, ser_sync_database_entry_selector, ser_sync_dupe_mover, ser_sync_file_utils, ser_sync_library, ser_sync_pref_sorter, ser_sync_track_index)
  - `src/` [DELETED] — empty after moves
  - `build.xml` [MODIFIED] — srcdir now compiles `shared/src:cdd-sync-pro/src:session-fixer/src`
  - `README.md` [MODIFIED] — Project Structure section updated
  - `md/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` [MODIFIED] — Directory Structure section updated
- **What Was Done**: Siloed the main sync tool's source files into `cdd-sync-pro/src/`, extracted 9 shared classes into `shared/src/`, and updated the Ant build to compile from all three source directories. All 24 source files compile and both JARs build successfully.
- **New Concepts**: None
- **Docs to Update**: README, CODEBASE_GUIDE (already updated), CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-12 — Scaffold Project Documentation

- **Task**: Create missing `md/` folder and documentation files
- **Files Changed**:
  - `md/TODO.md` [NEW]
  - `md/CHANGELOG.md` [NEW]
  - `md/CONCEPTS.md` [NEW]
  - `AGENT_LOG.md` [NEW]
- **What Was Done**: Scaffolded the `md/` documentation folder with initial `TODO.md` (backlog), `CHANGELOG.md` (seeded from git history), and `CONCEPTS.md` (Serato domain glossary). Created `AGENT_LOG.md` at project root.
- **New Concepts**: None (existing domain terms documented in `CONCEPTS.md`)
- **Docs to Update**: None — these are the initial docs
